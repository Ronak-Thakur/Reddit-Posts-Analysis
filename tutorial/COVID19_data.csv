16,fd29vj,FALSE,General,1231,Please consider downloading BOINC or folding@home to use your computers processor to help analyze COVID-19 research.,COVID19,"Hello all.

I believe this has been posted before on this sub, but I wanted to let many of the new members know about distributed computing and the potential it has to help research into COVID19.

Here are some initial comments on how [Rosetta@home](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2020/02/rosettas-role-in-fighting-coronavirus/) and [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/2020/02/27/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov/) are helping to combat COVID19.

Distributed computing is a fairly simple concept - a university, government research institution, etc takes a large chunk of data and breaks it up into small pieces.  The data is sent out to anyone who is a member of that research team, your computer does the number crunching, and the finished product is sent back to the institution to be added to the whole body of research.  Programs like Rosetta (using the BOINC client) or folding@home can run invisibly in the background, whenever you're not using the computer, or full time (I have three, soon to be four, computers running both clients full time, and a fourth I have running in the background).  The installation takes up a small amount of space, and you can easily control how much of your computer processing power you want dedicated to either program.

To download Folding@Home and join the reddit team:

* Visit this [link.](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/) to download the FAH client

* Open the FAHControl

* Click “configure”

* Select the “Identity” tab

* Input **236269** under “team number”

To download Rosetta@Home and join the Reddit team: 

* Visit this [link.](https://boinc.berkeley.edu)

* Open the BOINC client

* Select “tools” in the menu bar

* Select “add task” and choose from the scrolling menu “rosetta”.

* Go to [this](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/team.php) link, search for /r/covid19 (yes, I did name it after the COVID19 sub) and join the team.  Alternatively, it can also be found [here.]
(https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/team_display.php?teamid=18781)

If anyone has any questions, I would be happy to answer them.

#### Abstract

We examined the effect of intact human mast cells (HMC-1 5C6) and their selected mediators on interleukin-6 (IL-6) production and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Scanning electron microscopy showed that HMC-1 5C6 cells adhere to HCAEC in cocultures. Addition of HMC-1 5C6 cells markedly enhanced the IL-6 production by quiescent and LPS-activated HCAEC even at the maximal concentration of LPS. Furthermore, mast cell-derived histamine and proteases accounted for the direct and synergistic effect of mast cells on IL-6 production that was completely blocked by the combination of histamine receptor-1 antagonist and protease inhibitors. Another novel finding is that histamine was able to induce BMP-2 expression in HCAEC. Collectively, our results suggest that endotoxin and mast cell products synergistically amplify vascular inflammation and that histamine participates in the early events of vascular calcification.

#### 1. Introduction

Mast cells are normal constituents of the vessel wall and are primarily located in the connective tissue matrices. Increasing evidence suggests an important role for mast cells in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis \[1–4\], fibrosis \[5\], osteoporosis \[6\], and host defense \[7\]. The adventitia of coronary arteries of patients with atherosclerotic plaques contains increased number of mast cells \[1–3, 8–10\]. An increase in the number of tissue mast cells is also found to be associated with thrombus formation \[3\]. Mast cell granules have been identified within endothelial cells *in vivo* \[11\] and are known to cause proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells \[12\]. Furthermore, mast cell granule remnants can bind to low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and enhance their uptake by macrophages leading to the development of foam cells \[13, 14\]. We have previously shown that granules isolated from rat peritoneal mast cells interact with human endothelial cells in culture and enhance lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 \[15–17\]. These findings suggest that mast cells play an important role in endothelial cell activation and vascular inflammation. However, the interaction of human mast cells with human endothelial cells and its impact on inflammatory responses has not been evaluated.

Vascular endothelium regulates many aspects of the inflammatory response in addition to its well-recognized function as a protective barrier between blood and tissues. Activation of endothelial cells and resultant enhancement in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, prostanoids, and the expression of adhesion molecules are critical factors for the immune response and host defense as well as for the progression of inflammatory diseases. The cascade of endothelial activation can be initiated by both endogenous agonists such as inflammatory cytokines, lipid mediators, histamine, and proteases, and by exogenous agents including microbial agents. We have shown that the cell wall components of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can induce inflammatory responses in human endothelial cells \[15–18\] suggesting an important role for infectious agents in initiating vascular inflammation.

Mast cells synthesize and secrete many vasoactive substances and inflammatory mediators including histamine, proteases (tryptase, chymase, and carboxypeptidase A) prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, heparin, and cytokines \[19–23\]. Histamine and tryptase are two major secretory products of mast cells. The involvement of histamine in vascular disease is suggested by its elevated levels in the coronary circulation of patients with variant angina \[24\] and an increased expression of histamine H1receptor (H1R) in atherosclerotic lesions \[25\]. Previous reports from our laboratory show that histamine induces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-6 mRNA and the production of PGI2, PGE2, and IL-6 \[18, 26, 27\]. A number of reports have also documented the role of mast cells in the formation of foam cells \[13, 14\] and calcification of plaques \[9, 10\]. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2**)** is a key molecule in the calcification cascade and its expression in endothelial cells is induced by TNF-*α* or by mechanical stimuli \[28, 29\]. Although mast cells are involved in atherosclerotic plaque development \[9, 10\], direct effect of mast cell components on the expression of BMP-2 has not been explored. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of intact human mast cells and their products on the regulation of inflammatory and calcification responses in naïve and LPS-activated HCAEC.

#### 2. Materials and Methods

##### 2.1. Cells

Human coronary artery endothelial cells and endothelial cell growth medium (EGM-2MV) were obtained from Cambrex (San Diego, CA). Human mast cell line, subclone HMC-1 5C6 (derived from HMC-1 cells) was kindly provided by Dr. Michel Arock (Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan, Cachan, France).

##### 2.2. Culture of Endothelial Cells

HCAEC were grown in EGM-2MV containing 1 *μ*g/mL hydrocortisone acetate, 50 ng/mL gentamycin, 50 *μ*g/mL amphotericin B, and the recommended concentrations of human epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, human fibroblast growth factor, recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1, ascorbic acid, and 5% fetal bovine serum as described previously \[15, 16\]. At confluence, cells were detached from the culture flasks using trypsin-EDTA, washed twice, and resuspended in fresh EGM-2MV. The cells used in all experiments were between passages three and six.

##### 2.3. Mast Cells

HMC-1 5C6 cells were grown in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 10% FBS and 50 *μ*M of 2-mercaptoethanol at 37°C and 5% CO2. When applicable, mast cells were pretreated overnight with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo) containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride 1 mM, bestatin 40 *μ*M, E-64 14 *μ*M, leupeptin 20 *μ*M, pepstatin 15 *μ*M, and aprotinin 0.8 *μ*M. Protease inhibitor-treated mast cells were incubated with HCAEC and washed twice with EGM-2MV. Mast cells treated with EGM-2MV containing 1% DMSO were used as controls since DMSO was used as the vehicle to resuspend the protease inhibitor cocktail.

##### 2.4. Determination of IL-6 Production

HCAEC were seeded onto 96-well cell culture plate (1 × 104 cells/well) and allowed to adhere for 16 to 18 h. Following adherence, endothelial cell monolayers were incubated with mast cells or lysates derived from equivalent counts of mast cells in the presence or absence of LPS in a final volume of 0.2 mL at 37°C under 5% humidified CO2. After the indicated incubation period, culture supernatants were harvested, appropriately diluted, and assayed for IL-6 levels by ELISA \[16–18\].

#### 3. Results

In order to examine the effect of human mast cells, we compared the direct and synergistic effects of HMC-1 5C6 on IL-6 production by HCAEC.

##### 3.1. Effect of HMC-1 5C6 on IL-6 Production by HCAEC Stimulated with LPS

The effects of HMC-1 5C6 on IL-6 production by unactivated or LPS-treated HCAEC are presented in Figure [1](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2012/274347/fig1/). Unactivated HCAEC produced relatively low levels of IL-6 in a 24 h culture. However, LPS stimulated the production of IL-6 by HCAEC in a dose-dependent manner which attained a plateau at 100 ng/mL LPS. Presence of HMC-1 5C6 in the coculture, at an endothelial cell: mast cell ratio of 1 : 1 resulted in a marked potentiation of LPS-induced IL-6 production at all concentrations of LPS tested. It is of interest that mast cells alone induced a small but significant increase in IL-6 production by HCAEC. The amplification of LPS-induced cytokine production by HMC-1 5C6 was evident at LPS concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/mL and at higher doses (100 and 1000 ng/mL LPS). Once again, increased levels of IL-6 cannot be attributed to the IL-6 production by HMC-1 5C6 because these cells did not generate detectable amounts of IL-6 in the presence or absence of LPS (data not shown).

># Immunomodulation by vitamin B12: augmentation of CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cell activity in vitamin B12-deficient patients by methyl-B12 treatment

> 
> **Abstract**
> 
> It has been suggested that vitamin B12 (vit.B12) plays an important role in immune system regulation, but the details are still obscure. In order to examine the action of vit.B12 on cells of the human immune system, lymphocyte subpopulations and NK cell activity were evaluated in 11 patients with vit.B12 deficiency anaemia and in 13 control subjects. Decreases in the number of lymphocytes and CD8+ cells and in the proportion of CD4+ cells, an abnormally high CD4/CD8 ratio, and suppressed NK cell activity were noted in patients compared with control subjects. In all 11 patients and eight control subjects, these immune parameters were evaluated before and after methyl-B12 injection. The lymphocyte counts and number of CD8+ cells increased both in patients and in control subjects. The high CD4/CD8 ratio and suppressed NK cell activity were improved by methyl-B12 treatment. Augmentation of CD3−CD16+ cells occurred in patients after methyl-B12 treatment. In contrast, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, lectin-stimulated lymphocyte blast formation, and serum levels of immunoglobulins were not changed by methyl-B12 treatment. These results indicate that vit.B12 might play an important role in cellular immunity, especially relativing to CD8+ cells and the NK cell system, which suggests effects on cytotoxic cells. We conclude that vit.B12 acts as an immunomodulator for cellular immunity. ",6/2/2020 10:27

**Basics**:

* **Name of virus:** SARS-CoV-2

* **Name of illness:** COVID-19

* **R0 SARS-CoV-2**: 1.4 - 3.8 [2](https://bit.ly/2vpQDU6)

* **R0 Seasonal Influenza:** 1.28 [19](https://bit.ly/3afjSrk)

* ***Confirmed* Cases (World):** 92,137 (3/3/20 1300 EST) [13](https://ncov2019.live/data)

* ***Confirmed* Cases (Non-China):** 11,986 (3/3/20 1300 EST) [14](https://ncov2019.live/data)

* ***Confirmed* Cases (US):** 103 (3/3/20 1300 EST) [15](https://ncov2019.live/data)

* **Case Doubling Time (Non-China):** 4 days [18](https://coronainfo.xyz/)

* **Transmission Methods:** Respiratory droplet and touch/fomites [6](https://bit.ly/2VvvSAY), possible fecal-oral [21](https://wb.md/388zwDt), possible airborne (conditional) [28](https://bit.ly/2VynbWr)

* **Incubation Period:** 2-14 days [7](https://bit.ly/2T9cOXS)

* **Persistence on Inanimate Surfaces:** Highly dependent on surface and conditions. *Possibly* up to 9 days, but generally less than that [27](https://bit.ly/395aXIW),[29](https://bit.ly/3akp2CJ)

**Symptoms:** Fever, cough, SOB [8](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html). *It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough.* After a week, it can lead to shortness of breath, with about **20% of patients requiring hospital treatment**. Notably, the COVID-19 infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose, sneezing, or sore throat [9](https://bit.ly/2VCYOH8). Some atypical patients [may present](https://bit.ly/2TsQOWA) initially with GI symptoms.

**Clinical Features**: 
Clinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness. In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5–13 days). In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days. Between 23–32% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support. [30](https://bit.ly/2PzOzzD)

Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent *serious* manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. Most infections are not severe, although many patients have had critical illness. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity, 81 percent were mild (no or mild pneumonia). In a study involving patients with pneumonia, ""**lymphopenia** was common, and all patients had parenchymal lung abnormalities on computed tomography of the chest, including bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities. ... Among the six patients who died, D-dimer levels were higher and lymphopenia was more severe compared with survivors. [23](https://bit.ly/32ytr2b)

**Treatment**:

Healthcare personnel should care for patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection should be used when caring for the patient. ... The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. ... No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. **Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.** [31](https://bit.ly/2VwMvfu)

**Corticosteroids should be avoided** unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelinesexternal icon), because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients.

The following medications have either been tentatively shown to be efficacious, or are under investigation as treatment

* **Chloroquine Phosphate**: Antimalarial [showing promise](https://bit.ly/2PxAaEg) as a [treatment](https://bit.ly/2T7nztq)

**When to test:** [25](https://bit.ly/3cjEJeY)

* Fever or signs/symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g. cough or shortness of breath) **AND** Any person, including health care workers, who has had close contact) with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient within 14 days of symptom onset

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR

* Fever and signs/symptoms of a lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) requiring hospitalization **AND** A history of travel from affected geographic areas within 14 days of symptom onset

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR

* Fever with severe acute lower respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS) requiring hospitalization and without alternative explanatory diagnosis (e.g., influenza) **AND** *No source of exposure has been identified*

**How to test:** Healthcare providers should immediately notify both infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their local or state health department in the event of a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a COVID-19 PUI case investigation form available below.

**Death Rate Stats:**

Note that the following tables are based on information from Chinese CDC and derived from data on documented cases in the Chinese Infectious Disease Information System. The data is biased since it is derived from patients who were sick enough to be treated and documented by the Chinese health system. The actual numbers may be very different. Particularly, the death rate by pre-existing condition is likely to be much lower overall.

[Professor Chris Whitty](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/christopher-whitty) said the social cost of the virus may include primaries, secondaries, colleges and universities up and down the country shutting their doors for more than two months. He was speaking as it was confirmed that the UK now has 16 confirmed cases of Covid-19 – the first case in Northern Ireland.

Professor Whitty told the Nuffield Trust summit: ‘One of the things that’s really clear with this virus, much more so than flu, is that anything we do we’re going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months.’


Sports events and concerts may have to be cancelled and schools closed for more than two months if the UK is hit by a global pandemic of coronavirus, the chief medical officer has warned.


World Health Organization director-general Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva on Thursday that coronavirus has the potential to become a global pandemic but this stage had not been reached.

Senior doctors from hospitals across England have said that the NHS “would crumble” if the number of those infected reaches pandemic levels.

The situation would mean doctors having to make “tough decisions” in order to free up beds.


Ministers are finalising the government’s plan to respond to the increasing threat posed by coronavirus, which is expected to be published next week. [Matt Hancock](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/matthew-hancock), the health secretary, insisted: “There is a good chance that we can avoid a pandemic. That’s a potential outcome but not a definite outcome.”

Serious adverse events were reported for 114 of the 541 patients in the remdesivir group who underwent randomization (21.1%) and 141 of the 522 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization (27.0%).

While most numbers are similar in Table 1 for - it shows Remdesivir vs placebo (541 vs 522) having 125 vs 147 patients receiving ""invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO"".

Since we know most such patients die, this is an advantage of 22 patients more in the placebo - if nearly all of them died, that is a 4 percent disadvantage to the placebo, which may wash out the seeming advantage for Remdesivir they have shown in the Results:

**Western Point of View:** It's Irresponsible to Wear a Mask When You Aren't Sick

I'm seeing an ever-increasing number of articles from Canada / USA / UK telling people NOT to wear masks unless they are sick. Notably, the [US Surgeon General](https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160) tweeted as much a few days ago.

The main arguments against wearing one seem to be:

* It's causing a shortage of masks globally  
* People don't know how to use them properly, and may get infected by touching their face to readjust 
* The cheap surgical masks don't even work 

**Eastern Point of View:**  It's Irresponsible NOT to Wear a Mask When You Aren't Sick

On the other hand, I'm hearing from first hand reports in Korea that right now it's very socially taboo NOT to wear a mask. Certain malls or restaurants won't let people enter without a mask. 

The main arguments for wearing one seem to be:

* Any protection is better than nothing 
* Wearing one prevents you from touching your face
* You may be asymptomatic and sick without knowing it
* And perhaps [a sense of solidarity](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/opinion/coronavirus-face-mask-effective.html) (we are all in this together, instead of stigmatizing only the sick wearing masks) 

**Can This Debate Be Solved?**

As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it becomes more important than ever that the health authorities can agree on what is good health practice. And yet here we are, with radically different policies on masks implemented on different sides of the world. 

I'll ""show my cards"" on this issue: I have bought masks and intend to wear them if my city has a growing number of cases. After living in Asia I got used to wearing one when air quality was bad, so it's not a big deal for me. 

Still, I want to make an informed decision on the issue and not wear something that's useless. If the science is clear against wearing masks when healthy, I'll change my view. But all I've seen so far are opinions, not data.

So the question remains... to mask or not to mask?",https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fcwcn7/to_mask_or_not_to_mask_the_seemingly_endless/,404,"> It's causing a shortage of masks globally

Can be countered by: Failure to plan on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part. I've bought a small contingent of surgical masks for my family I intend to reuse (soaking in 70% isopropanol overnight should do the trick).

Why the emergency planners world wide (with a few exceptions) sat on their hands since mid-January while being unprepared to start with is a very good question which I hope will receive a follow-up. ",3/3/2020 15:40

They used a machine as a simulated infected patient, with people of various ages around the ""patient"". The machine was designed to simulate speaking, coughing, sneezing, and breathing - the people did a variety of activities; and all subjects wore a variety of masks as well as didn't wear masks.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/)

What was found was that in all cases any mask helps reduce transmission.

And masks were most effective in reducing what was inhaled rather than what was exhaled. Masks are more effective in protecting the non-infected than they are in stopping transmission. That's why HCPs always wear PPE but patients don't.

It's because we speak/sneeze/cough/exhale with greater velocity than we inhale, thus a filter is less effective on the exhale.

If you put a mask under a running faucet of water at the source, the water shoots right through with no disruption. If you put the mask further away from the source, more of the water is cupped in the mask (even if temporarily). The mask and water are unchanged, the only difference is the velocity in which the water is traveling, the reduced velocity makes stoppage and filtration efforts more effective. The less the velocity the more will be cupped in the masked and stopped from passing through. ",7/5/2020 12:13

If this principle is correct, 40% of cases are concentrated in 1.5% of the territory. Therefore, testing only 1.5% of the population (it would not be exactly that but in that order of magnitude) it is possible to reduce the transmission of the virus by 40%. Lockdown measures seem to reduce the transmission of the virus by 35% per day to around 5% per day, which prevents the number of infected people from multiplying by 65 in 14 days, but still increases it by 50% every 14 days (1-1.05¹⁴ = 1). This is because the lockdown appears to have an efficiency of 85% of a perfect quarantine. If 90% efficiency were achieved, the number of infected would drop by almost every 14 days (1–1.035¹⁴ = 0.6). Doing the massive tests and lockdown simultaneously, the country would have a 50% reduction in the number of infected people every 14 days. If the tests are repeated after these 14 days in the new 1.5% of the population, in 14 days of continuation of the lockdown the number of infected people will drop another 80% (1–1.017¹⁴ = 0.2). If the same process is repeated once more, the number of infected people will drop another 90%. In another 14 days and massive tests it will drop 95%, and then 98%, reaching zero cases for an initial number of infected from 20,000 to 100,000. In other words, the virus would be defeated in 70 days, requiring 3 million new tests every two weeks (which would cost R $ 1.5 billion), and the number of deaths would not exceed 200 across the country. Asian countries managed to identify most of those infected with massive tests and other monitoring measures that only exist there, today they hardly register new cases or deaths and are more concerned with preventing the entry of infected people into the country. These countries did not take full quarantine measures as in Italy because of this high capacity to find infected people in the population. European countries, on the other hand, had to opt for the lockdown to contain the virus, but this measure only extends the epidemic by reducing mortality, it does not defeat the virus as in the case of Asian containment strategies.

423,f8lofv,FALSE,Question,70,Why are so many young doctors dying of covid19 in Wuhan? It may be because they are exposed to a high viral load upon infection.,COVID19,"Recently there have been several tragic deaths of young doctors in Wuhan from covid19, including the 29-year-old [Dr. Xia Sisi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f86hfd/xia_sisi_a_29yearold_doctor_at_a_hospital_in/), the 29-year-old [Dr. Peng Yin Hua](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6zxfj/29_year_old_wuhan_respirologist_and_icu_doctor_dr/), the 42-year-old [Dr. Huang Wenjun](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8a8vn/huang_wenjun_a_42yearold_doctor_at_a_hospital/), and of course the 34-year-old [Dr. Li Wenliang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Wenliang). This is at some odds with general population data showing that deaths of covid19 tend to be highly concentrated in the elderly. It could be a statistical anomaly, but it does seem like death rates may be higher in young doctors than would be expected in the population. 

As an explanation, many of the most upvoted comments on these posts suggest that their immune systems might be suppressed due to overwork, poor sleep, and stress. To me, this seems to be an extremely unlikely explanation for many reasons, including the fact that doctors don't seem to die at relatively higher rates of other infectious illnesses such as influenza. 

However, some people have mentioned higher viral load as a possibility, which seemed more likely. I did some research and I found this 2005 study on the role of viral load in SARS (which is, of course, very similar to covid19): [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/12/pdfs/04-0949.pdf](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/12/pdfs/04-0949.pdf)

The study looked at an outbreak of sars in a particular housing area in Hong Kong. They found that people who had closer contact with the index patient had a higher nasopharyngeal viral load on admission as measured by RT-PCR. Crucially, they also found that people in this area were also the most likely to die. Some quotes: 

""**The median nasopharyngeal viral load in E block patients (5.09 log10 copies/mL) was much higher than in non-E block patients (0 log10 copies/mL) on admission (p<0.001)**... The overall case death rate among the 79 patients was 24.1%. The highest rate was in block E, which accounted for 79% of all deaths, while the death rate in patients living in E7 (the same block as the index patient) was 70% (7 patients). This rate is significantly higher than in other units (p = 0.001 by χ2 test). The index patient was one of the few patients from E7 who survived the disease.""

""Severity of illness did not differ between block E patients and non-E block patients when they were first seen at the hospital, despite higher viral load in block E patients. However, the death rate was higher in block E. **We have previously demonstrated that patients with high initial and peak viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples were more likely to show a less favorable disease course and lower survival rate (8,18).** Patients living in E7 who had highest nasopharyngeal viral loads explains why their death rate was higher than for those living in other units. The dilution effect resulted in a decreased viral load as the disease spread to other units and in a lower death rate.""

This data corroborates the viral load theory. It's not perfect evidence, but the theory also makes basic physiologic sense. A higher viral load on initial infection means that the virus will be able to do more damage and suppress the host's immune system further (lymphopenia) before the host can mount an immune response against the virus. 

Hospital workers are likely to be exposed to especially high viral loads of covid19. People who are hospitalized with covid19 infections are likely to cough more and require close contact for procedures such as IV placement and intubation. It is hard to know for sure, but healthcare transmission risk may have been especially high in the early stages of the epidemic in Wuhan, when people were not as aware of the high mortality rates of this disease. 

If viral load upon initial infection correlates with disease severity, this may also help to explain why some local clusters seem to have more severe disease, such as the family who all died of the disease. For some reason, people in these clusters may have been exposed to an especially high viral load. Ideally, we could measure the viral load of infected people with RT-PCR to test this, although it's hard enough to get basic yes/no tests for covid19 at this point. 

The viral load theory is not rock solid. It may not explain a large percentage of the variance in disease severity - certainly age seems to be a larger factor. But to me, it is clearly the leading theory why a disproportionate number of young doctors without apparent pre-existing health problems have died of covid19 in Wuhan. 

Healthcare workers putting themselves at risk to care for the sick during this pandemic are heroes. It is an urgent priority to have sufficient PPE available to our healthcare staff. We also need to have adequate space available to allow for the adequate distancing of staff and possibly infected patients. The viral load theory suggests that PPE and distancing are not only important for preventing healthcare workers from getting the illness but also decreasing the likelihood that they will die of the illness if they are infected.",https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/f8lofv/why_are_so_many_young_doctors_dying_of_covid19_in/,312,"I probably am repeating others so please just vote this to hell.

But to answer your question. I would postulate that they are literally working themselves to death.  Most cultures treat age and experience as something special. So many times younger doctors pick up 1 or 2 or more! Now these are just the normal times.  Add a crisis these younger doctors are picking up more shifts than usual.  

After a bit of time lack of sleep whacks the immune system. It will also cause one to make small mistakes. Normally these are probably dropping stuff or forgetting parts of conversations.  Now however these mistakes  not only raise the risk for the patient but also the staff.  Protocols end up not being followed creating a perfect storm.

This has been a huge known and accepted secret. Hospiral Doctors are from their residency all the way up as indentured servants.  They do there time no matter what and if the stars align they become someone special. ",2/24/2020 4:17

Recovered patients may still be infectious

In   a grim assessment, a key Chinese respiratory disease expert described   the situation of the epidemic as a “see-saw battle”, despite the drop  in  daily recorded cases in recent days.

“We   should not be relaxed. The figure may go up again,” said Zhao  Jianping,  head of an expert team working to contain the outbreak in  Hubei.

Zhao told the magazine *Southern People Weekly*   there were cases in China in which recovered patients continued to  show  traces of the virus through nucleic acid tests. There were similar   results in Canada, where nose and throat swabs taken from a couple who   had recovered from Covid-19 revealed they still had traces of the  virus.

459,faez60,FALSE,Containment Measure,50,CDC Pandemic Plan Super Detailed/Scoop to Nuts,COVID19,"The Original CDC Pandemic Plan was put out in Feb 2007. It can be located at [https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425) I have been asked how I know the things I post and my credentials have been questioned on numerous occasions. In addressing this, I have gone back and found important resources few if any even know are out there.  

This linked document is in effect, the foundational one for what the nation (US) is doing in relation to this emerging pandemic. It has far more detail than the 2017 iteration as it was a different time. The archived plan was a ""stand alone"" plan targeting Pan Flu, but designed for all pandemics. The newer materials are first founded on a dramatically improved national emergency response infrastructure, but that complexity itself requires you to drill down through multiple web pages to find various parts and pieces of what is being implemented. Much of what is done today ASSUMES a base knowledge vs the one from 2007. So, the 07 plan is everything from scoop to nuts in one place. 

Admitting I am biased, I assisted CDC in the writing of the linked plan above that partially was structured from one I had written. Dr. Besser was in charge of this area back then and was later the acting Director for CDC. In 2005, based upon the new global plan, I had created the Kansas Plan that was noted as a national model and was used as a foundation for other states and even some country plans. It can be found at [http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/practice/community-disease-containment-toolbox](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/practice/community-disease-containment-toolbox) 

In respect to the CDC plan in terms of detail, the linked plan above from 07, for example, goes into the details of how hard our populace would be hit based upon different R naught rates and different case fatality rates (300 million population) and essentially is a whole level of detail more than the 2017 plan.  This CDC plan is still the foundation of everything that is still being done today.  Today, however, there is a much more robust emergency planning infrastructure in place.  But the advantage of the original plan is that it is everything in ONE place that later spread out across a much more complex layered set of emergency preparedness capabilities. [https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/readiness/capabilities.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/readiness/capabilities.htm) 

So, if you want to fully explore the historical underpinnings of what is being done today...in exquisite detail, take a look.  It has the answers to many of the questions that arise on these sub-reddits.

Some WHO experts and Chinese experts have disputed this, arguing that the 2% CFR remains supported. I would posit that recent evidence of undetected spread within Washington argues that there is an iceberg, and South Korean data, though still very preliminary, is pointing to a lower CFR (I think it's 0.64% so far).

The thing is, I know that a CFR of around 0.1% might be akin to influenza, but I don't think that R-naught and CFR paint the whole picture socioeconomically; it is important to know what the threshold is above which hospitals will become overwhelmed in numerous major cities, which would really raise this into a humanitarian crisis.

I think it is much harder to estimate what the situation would look like if CFR is somewhere like 0.6%, as there are no good comparisons to what that looks like.

**tl;dr CFR remains debatable, probably somewhere between 0.2% and 2.0%, but what really matters will be whether it's enough to overwhelm the healthcare system broadly.**

**Does anyone have a good English-translated or English-language report of what the situation on the ground in South Korea looks like?** I think this may be an informative model for what to expect in several weeks in the USA and elsewhere in best-case scenarios, as SK is taking very reasonable measures, while doing so with more transparency and less draconian measures than China.

**EDIT: I don't intend to try to calculate CFR. My premise is that the CFR will remain uncertain for some time due to the multiple variables that play into it. I just used those numbers as examples, because regardless of where it falls within that range, recent epidemics/pandemics are not easily comparable to this.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fcmb8d/iceberg_or_no_iceberg_cfr_02_or_2_the_real/,270,"Are those really reasonable bounds?

I was playing games on my computer when I gradually started feeling weak over the span of an hour I'd say. I was starting to lose concentration of what I was doing in the game and at some point, it was like someone had opened the door of a really cold freezer next to me. I started shivering, slowly at first, but enough that I went to my room to put warmer clothes.

At that point, my concentration was affected enough that I did not even want to continue playing the game on the computer. I went to my bed (shivering uncontrollably in my warm clothes) and put on 2 blankets on top of me. That night turned out to be a terrible time. I gradually stopped shivering and instead started sweating. I kept trying to sleep but I was having all sorts of weird thoughts until, the sweating was so bad, that I had to take everything off of me. I was also feeling thirsty, my throat was super dry, but I was also feeling so weak, that I did not want to get out of the bed to go get a glass. The dryness was so bad that I had to kick myself in the ass and try to go get some water.

I remember , trying to get out of the bed was so hard that I literally crawled to the kitchen. Once there, I realized that I had to stand up to get a glass. I was feeling so weak and out of breath from the crawl that I rested on the floor of the kitchen a good 15 minutes before gathering the energy to lift myself on the counter to open the cabinets. I slowly got my glass and then opened the fridge to get a pitcher of cold water that i had in there. It was so hard to lift the pitcher that I almost fainted from shortness of breath. I brought the pitcher to the floor and collapsed next to it, taking another 15-20 minute rest before gathering my energy again to pour the water into my glass.

Drinking the water made me feel somewhat better but I dreaded the energy it would take to go back to my bed. So I slept on the kitchen floor for the remainder of the night. Some dark thoughts went through my mind. I wanted to call an ambulance, but I felt like if I did, nothing they would do could make me feel any better. I convinced myself that if my time had come... so be it. I am 37 year old, with a healthy weight. I run 3 times a week and do long bicycle rides on the weekends. I am no athlete but I consider myself above average fitness. Never have I felt so sick in my life.

Naturally, I got better the next day. Went to see a doctor and he told me that I had a simple cold, without much examination, and that drinking water and having some rest was the only thing to do. That was 3 years ago, is this what having the coronavirus feel like ? I sure hope not because that was the worst experience of my life ! ",3/14/2020 15:33

* Median time from hospitalization to death is estimated to be 12.4 days
* The incubation period from exposure to symptom onset is estimated to be 5.4 (4.2 - 6.7) days.
* The mean time from first symptoms to death is 18 days (time to recovery is not dissimilar)
* Infection count doubled in Wuhan every 6.4 days early in the disease outbreak
* The overall confirmed-case-fatality-ratio is estimated to be 33% *(This seems crazy to me, I can't totally wrap my head around it. I think it must be due to the fact that at the beginning of the outbreak, the Chinese only tested for COVID19 in patients with severe pneumonia.)*

Lots of sources say the CFR for seasonal flu is approximately 0.1% (a ""case"" is a flu infection where the infected person displays at least some flu symptoms).

When people here simply don't believe the threat exists, or at the very least suggest that taking it seriously is 'panicking,' you get threads like this one.  This subreddit is extremely averse to speaking about the virus in anything other than an optimistic light, yet it believes that the sky is falling in our approach to mitigating the deaths.

I don’t know how the Austrian health care system works. How do the centers come by their patients? Is it referral? Do most of the patients coming to them have known (to the patient and another MD inside or outside the acute coronary facility) cardiac disease? Do people in Austria know they exist and come on their own if they have a sudden experience of chest pain or dyspnea on exertion? 
Since I’m in the United States, I’m not aware that we have such designated facilities here. 
How do the ACS themselves deal with triage of patients   Who are considered candidates for entry into their system? 
The authors themselves were pretty clear about the number of deaths due to Covid being much less than deaths expected from ACS (110). But it isn’t clear how death rates estimated over all apply to people who come to their facilities. 
They are recommending that cardiologists attend to these skewed outcomes.

There are a lot of questions about RT-PCR and diagnostic testing for the virus floating around the sub. With people worried about how detection is happening and how effectively we can detect the virus, we thought a primer on RT-PCR would be useful since the bulk of countries are using these assays to confirm a patient is infected.

&#x200B;

RT-PCR starts like any other PCR process, which in turn starts with some buffers, free nucleotides, some salts, polymerases (these guys make the DNA) and a template with some primers. In the case of diagnostic PCR, your template will almost always be patient samples, which are being added to this little mix with primers that will find the target sequence if it exists in that DNA.   


RT-PCR is different in that it uses reverse transcriptases to quantify mRNA, meaning your starting point is actually RNA instead of DNA.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ztelz23tvsj41.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e6794082c54b4c8043ee99a9bf729097e23977a

Now, mRNAs are the little dudes responsible for taking messages transcribed from your DNA to the ribosome for processing into protein. For your cells this is just part of the normal process of doing business, but for viruses this is a potential way for them to essentially break and enter into the cell. Viruses, being obligate intracellular parasites without the ability to reproduce on their own, find all kinds of ways to hijack your cells.

Positive-sense RNA viruses like SARS-2-CoV basically encode their payload as mRNA already. There's no need for risky, energetically intensive replication or integration into the host genome off the bat. These guys can dump their RNA into the cell and have it go right to the ribosome to trick the cell into making more virus right away, giving the virus a nice new home to grow many, many virions (viral particles) from.

Getting back to the RT-PCR, you can essentially use it to directly amplify SARS-2-CoV from samples because the RT-PCR polymerases target mRNAs. Using the right primers (based on the sequence posted back in January) you can take any sample from a tissue where the virus is known to hang out (such as the nasopharyngeal swabs) and then put them through an extraction prep process to get a prepared, testable sample.   


These samples are then quantified against an established cutoff threshold (cutoff determinance is a whole different talk, I can answer questions on it in the comments).

To do the quantification, there are a number of options but they basically all work on the same principles:

 Absolute quantification relies on examining fluorescence with SYBRGreen (a molecular fluorescent dye) or a multi-color probeset. 

Relative quantification relies on getting a reference gene and using the results from that to calculate a relative quantity against the known reference gene standard (meaning this value is tied to your reference gene, but still gives a good idea of what your copy number looks like). 

CDC's assay has positive and negative template controls as well as an extraction control (did your extraction work) and RP (a specimen quality control gene with a known maximum expected amplification threshold of 35 cycles for the CDC assay).

&#x200B;

There are three SARS-2-CoV probes in the mix, N1, N2 and N3. Together they determine the success or failure of the assay, along with the status of the controls for the assay. Controls are very important because they tell you if your assay is working.

&#x200B;

CDC's assay results would generally look something like this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kcbk141zvsj41.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=97cf0aa96bae7e616c61c70e2f517f9a1f8ac0f4

  
Results are dispositioned as follows from their protocol:  
 

* When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered negative if all 2019-nCoV markers (N1, N2, N3) cycle threshold growth curves DO NOT cross the threshold AND the RNase P growth curve DOES cross the threshold line.
* When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered positive for 2019-nCoV if all markers (N1, N2, N3) cycle threshold growth curve crosses the threshold line. The RNase P may or may not be positive as described above, but the 2019-nCoV result is still valid.
* When all controls exhibit the expected performance and the growth curves for the 2019-nCoV markers (N1, N2, N3) AND the RNase P marker DO NOT cross the cycle threshold growth curve, the result is invalid. The extracted RNA from the specimen should be re-tested. If residual RNA is not available, re-extract RNA from residual specimen and re-test. If the re-tested sample is negative for all markers and all controls exhibit the expected performance, the result is “Invalid.”
* When all controls exhibit the expected performance and the cycle threshold growth curve for any one or two markers, (N1, N2, N3) but not all three crosses the threshold line the result is inconclusive for 2019-nCoV. Re-extract RNA from residual specimen and re-test.

&#x200B;

Basically, when everything amplifies, if the probes for the virus are above the threshold and the controls fall where they are expected to. Failed controls result in different things (which is in detail in the protocol here:  [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-detection-instructions.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-detection-instructions.html) ).

Though the official timeslot for the Q&A is over I'm happy for late questions to come in and I'll answer them as and when I can.**

What will it mean if SARS-Cov2 does become a pandemic? Should it be considered one already?

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ystkFwEqEV7Vt5JJbo3jRwtiuRiphDqK6\_NmStu3a-o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ystkFwEqEV7Vt5JJbo3jRwtiuRiphDqK6_NmStu3a-o/edit?usp=sharing)

At 10.00PM-11.00 GMT this evening - Tuesday 25 Feb - I'll be doing a live AMA on what it means for COVID19 to be declared a pandemic or not.

The link post above takes you through to some background reading, based on my background as a Senior Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in the UK, a policy think tank that works closely with UK and international governments on resilience and security policy. I worked at RUSI from 2007-2017 before moving into academia where I currently research global health (in particular, antibiotic resistance in India) and health information exchange online. My PhD was on reddit, and health information exchange during the Ebola outbreak.

Pandemic disease spread is the highest risk on the UK's National Risk Register, resulting in preparedness plans across many government agencies and strategies to keep healthcare, supply chains, energy and transport infrastructure running smoothly should such an eventuality come to pass. Most of the UK's plans - like those of most countries - are publicly available online and can provide reassurance that consequences have been considered, and that work is ongoing behind the scenes to minimise any impact the disease will have.

Please do check out the document in the link above, and you can find other examples of my research here:

It has an interesting Table S1 with proportions of severe/critical by age. The discussion on page 11 show the odds ratios (20-40 as baseline=1): (strangely no info about 10-20, it may be a misprint):

* <=10: 0.33
* 20-40: 1.00
* 40-60: 1.44
* 60-80: 2.76
* >=80: 5.11

Since the mortality has steeper odds ratio, it seems that young people have lowered sever incidence but most importantly have better odds of surviving that. And if I'm not wrong recalculating the absolute values with these odds data, the critical cases are:

* <=10: 0.5%
* 20-40: 1.5%

If this principle is correct, 40% of cases are concentrated in 1.5% of the territory. Therefore, testing only 1.5% of the population (it would not be exactly that but in that order of magnitude) it is possible to reduce the transmission of the virus by 40%. Lockdown measures seem to reduce the transmission of the virus by 35% per day to around 5% per day, which prevents the number of infected people from multiplying by 65 in 14 days, but still increases it by 50% every 14 days (1-1.05¹⁴ = 1). This is because the lockdown appears to have an efficiency of 85% of a perfect quarantine. If 90% efficiency were achieved, the number of infected would drop by almost every 14 days (1–1.035¹⁴ = 0.6). Doing the massive tests and lockdown simultaneously, the country would have a 50% reduction in the number of infected people every 14 days. If the tests are repeated after these 14 days in the new 1.5% of the population, in 14 days of continuation of the lockdown the number of infected people will drop another 80% (1–1.017¹⁴ = 0.2). If the same process is repeated once more, the number of infected people will drop another 90%. In another 14 days and massive tests it will drop 95%, and then 98%, reaching zero cases for an initial number of infected from 20,000 to 100,000. In other words, the virus would be defeated in 70 days, requiring 3 million new tests every two weeks (which would cost R $ 1.5 billion), and the number of deaths would not exceed 200 across the country. Asian countries managed to identify most of those infected with massive tests and other monitoring measures that only exist there, today they hardly register new cases or deaths and are more concerned with preventing the entry of infected people into the country. These countries did not take full quarantine measures as in Italy because of this high capacity to find infected people in the population. European countries, on the other hand, had to opt for the lockdown to contain the virus, but this measure only extends the epidemic by reducing mortality, it does not defeat the virus as in the case of Asian containment strategies. This measure combining mass tests following the Pareto principle and lockdown seems to me to make some sense at this point and be the best possible solution outside of Asia.

I'm rusty on my population genetics analysis but I think I understood what was essentially done to create this binary distinction.

They used linkage analysis, which is normally used in the context of recombining chromosomes in sexually reproducing eukaryotes. What the underlying mechanisms are in the case of an asexually reproducing virus to make this a valid approach are currently beyond my understanding.

I'll assume there's something to it, then. But delving deeper this study of linkage just seems like a very coarse grained and pre-genomics way of creating a phylogeny.

We can make phylogenies with full sequencing and computational techniques. It's a very well described optimization exercise to find parsimony. And it gives us trees like the ones on www.nextstrain.org/ncov

Look at the phylogenetic tree with 164 genomes (and counting) and explain to me where it makes sense to split it into exactly two pieces. It doesn't matter how they decided to make this distinction, in the end that's what they're basically doing. Am I misunderstanding something here?

The most dubious part of the article was the sheer amount of hand waving in the discussion to convince the reader of their particular branch of the tree being critical. Literally comparing different numbers of genomes that fall into one category or the other. They assume that every genome is part of a representative and random sample of genomes when it most certainly isn't at this stage. Most genomes come from very few areas (even fewer when this was written) because the world is not systematically testing at anywhere near what they should. I don't even want to bother with the confusion of what they mean by one being ""more aggressive"". They don't even know what that means.

Now people are taking the ball and running with it, saying now that we have two distinct ""strains"" that ""re-infection"" is now possible. This basically opens the floodgates to all kinds of ultimately rootless speculation.

Just look at this telegraph article headline https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2020/03/04/coronavirus-has-mutated-aggressive-disease-say-scientists/

Students on the other hand, were most likely to be infected by adults, either their teacher or parent, who most likely were infected during parent- teacher meetings.”

This is an interesting conclusion. I read this as, the adult-adult transfer is much higher (as expected). Yet, because adult-child is still a thing, it ends up being a breakout no matter how you slice it. It doesn’t matter if child-child or child-adult transmission rates are low. I’d diverge from the authors here (who suggest it was staff-parent transmission first, then parent-child) and speculate in the home environment child-parent can still be high especially in the very young because no parent can distance themselves from a young one.

It’s only relied upon in routine or casual clinical encounters due to cost and lower radiation. If those were no object CT would be standard of care any time you needed a good look at the lungs. ,7/13/2020 22:56

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4607301/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4607301/)  
As this paper was published in 2015 it's surprising to read ""Vitamin D and Endothelial Function"" and discover it  totally fails to take account of the fact that cholecalciferol is active in that basic form, stabilising the endothelium and providing the signalling modality that inhibits inflammation.

shows that to keep cholecalciferol free available in serum requires natural 25(OH)D well above 40ng/ml and as the half life cholecalciferol in serum is 24hrs only daily dosing enables the functions of all forms of vitamin d3. ",7/8/2020 23:07

So, when you've treated them, do they still create their own antibodies? And with the ratio in mind, can you scale it effectively until CR3022 or another monoclonal antibody is produced at scale?

Edit: I've been informed that actually one patient can treat three so I'm incorrect.
